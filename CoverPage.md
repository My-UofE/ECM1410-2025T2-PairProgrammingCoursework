Please write below a short statement detailing how you used GenAI tools to assist in your submission:


throughout the project genAI was used to help us further our understanding of a question or syntax used. When making a new Classes such as Player and League we used ai to produce a skeleton code that we could then flesh out. Some parts of the code we were unsure exactly what to do so we'd go online to find examples of code on websites such as w3schools, with this we then asked ChatGPT to further explain how this works and when it is best to be used. We always made sure every piece of code in our project could be fully understood and explained by both partners and was made by one of us.
